            <p>Q - Can I avail domestic flight offers on TravelEase?</p>
            <p>
              Of course, you can. While making domestic flight bookings, you
              can avail any special offer that is active at that time. In
              accordance with the offer selected, a listing of eligible cheapest
              flights would show up on your screen. You can then apply the price
              filter and click on the downwards arrow, following which
              budget-friendly flights would start showing up in ascending order
              from the top (lowest price on top).

            <p>Q - How can I avail budget air tickets on TravelEase?</p>
            <p>
              It’s super-easy to avail budget airfare while booking your
              cheap flight tickets on TravelEase. Just select the ‘Price’ filter
              once the available flight options are displayed and adjust
              according to your convenience. On the TravelEase app, you can

              Q - Why I couldn't avail the flight booking offers at the time of
              checkout?
            </p>
            <p>
              TravelEase makes use of a world-class real-time reservation
              database to list airfare and availability. As dynamic changes in
              airfare take place, or the available flight tickets sell out, the
              database reflects the changes in real-time. Hence, we suggest, you
              double-check online flight booking prices when purchasing flight
              tickets, as the airfare might have been dynamically updated since
              you first selected the air travel dates or planned your itinerary.
